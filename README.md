## What is MCP?

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is a system that lets AI apps, like [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), connect to external tools and data sources. It gives a clear and safe way for AI assistants to work with local services and APIs while keeping the user in control.

## What is Pica?

[Pica](https://picaos.com) is a powerful agentic tooling platform that enables connections to 70+ third-party services and applications. This MCP server allows Claude Desktop and anything using the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) to securely interact with all these connections through natural language requests.

With Pica MCP Server, you can:

- **Access Multiple Data Sources**: Query databases, fetch files, and retrieve information across services
- **Automate Workflows**: Trigger actions and automate tasks across your connected platforms
- **Enhance LLM Capabilities**: Give Claude Desktop powerful real-world capabilities through API access

### Installing via Smithery

To install pica for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@picahq/pica):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @picahq/pica --client claude
```

### Environment Setup

This server requires a [Pica API key](https://app.picaos.com/settings/api-keys). Set the environment variable:

```bash
export PICA_SECRET=your_pica_secret_key
```

### Using Docker

Build the Docker Image:

```bash
docker build -t pica-mcp-server .
```

Run the Docker Container:

```bash
docker run -e PICA_SECRET=your_pica_secret_key pica-mcp-server
```

### Manual Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build the server:

```bash
npm run build
```

For development with auto-rebuild:
```bash
npm run watch
```

### Using Claude Desktop

To use with [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), add the server config:

On MacOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

#### Docker

To use the Docker container with Claude Desktop, update your `claude_desktop_config.json` with:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pica-mcp-server": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-e", "PICA_SECRET=YOUR_PICA_SECRET_KEY",
        "pica-mcp-server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Manual

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pica-mcp-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/pica-mcp-server/build/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PICA_SECRET": "YOUR_PICA_SECRET_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Debugging

Since MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), which is available as a package script:

```bash
npm run inspector
```

The Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.
